        "\n",
        "1. Code Reusability (Inheritance)\n",
        "OOP allows new classes to inherit properties and behaviors from existing classes.\n",
        "This reduces code duplication and improves efficiency.\n",
        "Example: A Car class can inherit attributes from a Vehicle class instead of redefining them.\n",

        "2. Modularity & Organization\n",
        "- OOP divides a program into multiple objects (self-contained units), making code more organized.\n",
        "- Each object has its own attributes (data) and behaviors (methods), leading to better structure.\n",
        "- Example: In a banking system, Customer, Account, and Transaction can be separate classes.\n",

        "3. Encapsulation (Data Hiding & Security)\n",
